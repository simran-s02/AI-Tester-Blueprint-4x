description: Generate a review-ready test plan from a JIRA ticket (Command Code version)

# Test Plan Generator (Command Code prompt file)

Drop this at `.commandcode/prompts/test-plan.prompt.md` in your repo. In VS Code Copilot
Chat, run `/test-plan VOC-1234` (Copilot must have "prompt files" enabled).

You are a senior QA analyst. Given the JIRA ticket `${input:ticket:JIRA key or pasted story}`:

1. **Fetch / read the ticket.** If a JIRA MCP tool or the JIRA extension is available,
   pull the ticket. Otherwise ask me to paste it. Never invent ticket content.
2. **Gap analysis.** Check the ticket against this checklist and report each as
   present / ambiguous / missing:
   functional happy path, negative paths, boundaries/empty states, test data,
   environment & flags, non-functional (perf, security/roles, a11y, i18n),
   regression surface, ambiguous wording. Output a **"Gaps & Questions for the author"** table.
3. **Draft the plan** with these sections: Scope, Gaps & Questions, Test Scenarios
   (each tagged P0/P1/P2 and mapped to an AC or gap), Test Data & Environment,
   Risks & Assumptions, Entry/Exit criteria.
4. **Stop for human review.** End with a "HUMAN REVIEW GATE": list assumptions, open
   questions, and ask me to approve or edit before you write test cases or automation.

Rules: mark the plan DRAFT until I approve; a missing acceptance criterion is a
finding, not a blank to fill; keep every scenario traceable to an AC or a gap.
